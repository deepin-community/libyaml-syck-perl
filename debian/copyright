License: Death-and-Repudiation
 This software may not be used directly by any living being. ANY use of this
 software (even perfectly legitimate and non-commercial uses) until after death
 is explicitly restricted. Any living being using (or attempting to use) this
 software will be punished to the fullest extent of the law.
 .
 For your protection, corpses will not be punished.  We respectfully request
 that you submit your uses (revisions, uses, distributions, uses, etc.) to
 your children, who may vicariously perform these uses on your behalf.  If
 you use this software and you are found to be not dead, you will be punished
 to the fullest extent of the law.
 .
 If you are found to be a ghost or angel, you will be punished to the fullest
 extent of the law.
 .
 After your following the terms of this license, the author has vowed to
 repudiate your claim, meaning that the validity of this contract will no
 longer be recognized. This license will be unexpectedly revoked (at a time
 which is designated to be most inconvenient) and involved heirs will be
 punished to the fullest extent of the law.
 .
 Furthermore, if any parties (related or non-related) escape the punishments
 outlined herein, they will be severely punished to the fullest extent of a new
 revised law that (1) expands the statement "fullest extent of the law" to
 encompass an infinite duration of infinite punishments and (2) exacts said
 punishments upon all parties (related or non-related).
